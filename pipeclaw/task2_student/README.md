# Task 2: MS-SWIFT Student Distillation

This directory contains the reproducible Task 2 pipeline for distilling the
finalized teacher traces into an external lightweight decision model. It does
not retrain PipeFormer and does not modify PipeClaw's Task 1 dataset.

## Authoritative inputs

The source splits are read-only:

- `pipeclaw/backend/generated_teacher_traces/splits/teacher_trace_train.jsonl`
- `pipeclaw/backend/generated_teacher_traces/splits/teacher_trace_valid.jsonl`
- `pipeclaw/backend/generated_teacher_traces/splits/teacher_trace_test.jsonl`

The frozen source counts are 902 / 124 / 114. Derived records must preserve
sample IDs and split assignments. The test split is reserved for final
evaluation.

## Framework and models

- Framework: MS-SWIFT 4.x
- Local smoke test: `Qwen/Qwen3.5-0.8B`
- Main remote student: `Qwen/Qwen3.5-9B`
- Adaptation: 4-bit QLoRA

Task 2 uses a dedicated WSL2/Ubuntu Python environment. It does not install
MS-SWIFT into the existing PipeClaw backend environment.

## Layout

- `configs/`: reviewed local and remote experiment commands.
- `data/`: deterministic answer-only, trace-level, and constraint-aware
  projections plus checksum manifests.
- `scripts/`: dataset preparation, validation, token profiling, evaluation,
  and comparison programs.
- `tests/`: Task 2 unit and contract tests.
- `outputs/`: ignored local checkpoints, predictions, and logs.

Generated JSONL, model weights, checkpoints, and caches are not committed.
Small manifests and summary metrics may be committed after review.

## Workflow

1. Convert the immutable Task 1 splits into framework-neutral agent records.
2. Validate identities, split isolation, tool-call pairs, and loss masking.
3. Profile exact Qwen3.5 token lengths without silent truncation.
4. Run the local 0.8B smoke test.
5. Compare answer-only, trace-level, and constraint-aware SFT.
6. Reuse the same artifacts for the remote 9B experiment.
